# MUX Compiler

## About 
Hello its my side project its a programming language called MUX
Its programming language for:

Memory management 
Memory safety
Type safety

I got its inspiration from:

C,Rust,Typescript

Why its diffrent:

well not even compilted yet but still 
I have plans to add 

Higher Dimensonal Datatypes
Shadow Vectors
Multidimensonal Arrays (1 - 5th)

## Syntax

```#mux

def main() {
    int x = 10;
    string msg = "Hello";
    
}
```

You can remove #mux in this version but later its important to add #mux on top of the file
files format is .mux
also you can make more functions like 

```
#mux

def main() {
    int x = 10;
    string msg = "Hello";
    
}

def mainFunc(){
    int x = 20;
}
```

but you cant change the name of main function like from 
main to mainFunc or Main 

variables are not case sensitive 

## How to compile

Download the muxc.exe from releases

```
./muxc filename.mux

```

If you want compile by yourself do it
In Windows

```
./build.bat
./muxc examples/hello,ux

```

Linux

```
./build.sh
./muxc filename.mux
```

MacOS

## What To Do
